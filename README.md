# py-scraper
Let's build a scraper service to collect dataset. For now, let's just put your scraping project as a modules. You can submit either in .ipynb or .py format, just make sure it is written in python language. You are also allowed to submit a project that actually not literally scrap particular website, instead only request API to third-party. As long as your project are readable and written in python, it still acceptable.
After we collect some scraping projects (we will consider it later as modules), then let's together productionize it as a services.
